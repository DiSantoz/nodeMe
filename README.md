# nodeMe

Using Node and NPM Inquirer I developed a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file based on the user's inputs!


1. Git clone my repository 2. On the command line, in the root of the directory type 'npm install' 3. Make sure that package.json, package-lock.json and node_modules is all properly displaying

Please see attached video on how to use this application!

After following the installation process and usage steps above, generate your first READMe! You then can simply copy the contents of the ReadMeGnrt file and paste it to your projects own READMe in VSCode or in GitHub and save a ton of time!
